= interface EventClientCodec

Codec interface for converting between domain events and wire format.

EventClientCodec provides the serialization/deserialization layer between EventicleEvent (domain representation) and EncodedEvent (wire representation). Different implementations can provide JSON, Avro, Protocol Buffers, or custom encoding schemes.

The codec is responsible for: - Serializing event payloads and metadata - Handling distributed tracing headers - Version compatibility and schema evolution - Compression and encryption (if needed)
