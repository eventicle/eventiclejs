= interface EventAdapter

Defines an event adapter for real-time event processing and integration.

EventAdapter provides a hot-subscription pattern for processing live events as they occur, without replaying historical data. Unlike EventView which processes both historical and live events, adapters focus on real-time integration scenarios like external system synchronization, notifications, and live data feeds.

Key Characteristics: - \*\*Hot Subscription Only\*\*: Processes new events, never replays history - \*\*External Integration\*\*: Designed for pushing data to external systems - \*\*Transactional\*\*: Each event is processed within a database transaction - \*\*Error Handling\*\*: Built-in error recovery and monitoring - \*\*Consumer Groups\*\*: Supports load balancing across multiple instances



== Properties

[id="eventicle_eventiclejs_EventAdapter_consumerGroup_member"]
=== consumerGroup

========

Consumer group identifier for load balancing and failure recovery.

Multiple adapter instances with the same consumer group will share event processing, enabling horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

----
consumerGroup: string;

========
[id="eventicle_eventiclejs_EventAdapter_deleteConsumerGroupOnClose_member"]
=== deleteConsumerGroupOnClose

========

When true, deletes the Kafka consumer group when the adapter is closed.

Useful for ephemeral adapters with dynamic consumer groups (e.g., UUID-based) to prevent accumulation of stale consumer groups in Kafka.

deleteConsumerGroupOnClose?: boolean;

[id="eventicle_eventiclejs_EventAdapter_errorHandler_member"]
=== errorHandler

========

Optional custom error handler for event processing failures.

If not provided, a default handler logs the error and continues processing. Use this for custom error reporting, retry logic, or dead letter queues.




.Signature
[source,typescript]
----
errorHandler?: (adapter: EventAdapter, event: EventicleEvent, error: Error) => Promise<void>;
----

========
[id="eventicle_eventiclejs_EventAdapter_handleEvent_member"]
=== handleEvent

========

Event processing function called for each live event.

Should be idempotent as events may be redelivered during failures. Typically integrates with external systems or triggers side effects.




.Signature
[source,typescript]
----
handleEvent: (event: EventicleEvent) => Promise<void>;
----

========
[id="eventicle_eventiclejs_EventAdapter_name_member"]
=== name

========

Unique adapter identifier for monitoring and debugging.

Should be descriptive of the adapter's purpose (e.g., 'crm-sync', 'email-notifications').




.Signature
[source,typescript]
----
name: string;
----

========
[id="eventicle_eventiclejs_EventAdapter_streamsToSubscribe_member"]
=== streamsToSubscribe

========

List of event streams to monitor for live events.

Adapter will receive all new events from these streams. Use specific stream names to reduce noise and improve performance.




.Signature
[source,typescript]
----
streamsToSubscribe: string[];
