summary: >-
  Standard return type for all command executions in Eventicle.


  CommandReturn provides a consistent interface for command results, separating the response data (returned to caller)
  from domain events (published to streams). This enables clean separation between synchronous API responses and
  asynchronous event-driven side effects.

   T - Type of the response data returned to the caller
remarks: ''
example:
  - |-
    Successful command with response

    ```typescript
    const result: CommandReturn<{userId: string}> = {
      response: { userId: 'user-123' },
      events: [{
        type: 'UserCreated',
        domainId: 'user-123',
        data: { email: 'john@example.com', name: 'John Doe' }
      }]
    };
    ```
  - |-
    Command with business error

    ```typescript
    const result: CommandReturn<void> = {
      events: [{
        type: 'PaymentFailed',
        domainId: 'payment-456',
        data: { reason: 'Insufficient funds' }
      }],
      webError: new Error('Payment processing failed')
    };

    fullName: events
    summary: >-
      Domain events generated during command execution.


      These events are automatically published to the command's configured stream and become part of the permanent event
      history. Events represent facts about what happened and drive all downstream processing.

    summary: >-
      Optional response data returned to the command caller.


      Typically contains generated IDs, confirmation data, or other information needed by the synchronous caller. This
      data is NOT published as events.

    fullName: webError
    summary: >-
      Optional error to throw after event emission.


      Allows commands to emit failure events while still signaling errors to callers. The events are published first,
      then this error is thrown to the caller, enabling both event-driven error handling and traditional exception
      handling.
